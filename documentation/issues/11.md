# REALLY Implement "weave inclusions list" Command

## Current State

The codebase currently has a `weave repos list` command that shows information about git repositories, but lacks a dedicated `weave inclusions list` command that would display information about all types of inclusions (git, web, local).

Issue #3 mentioned implementing this command, but it appears that only the `repos list` command was implemented, and the issue was closed without implementing the specific `inclusions list` command.

## Proposed Solution

Implement a new `weave inclusions list` command that:

1. Lists all active inclusions and their statuses (present/missing, copy strategy, exclude)
2. Orders inclusions by their `order` property
3. Supports both table and JSON output formats via a `--format` option
4. Shows information for all inclusion types (git, web, local)

## Implementation Plan

1. **Core Functionality**:
   - Create a new `src/core/inclusionsList.ts` file that returns data as JSON, containing all inclusions and their statuses
   - Include information for all inclusion types (git, web, local)
   - Reuse existing utility functions where possible (e.g., `checkGitInclusion` for git inclusions)
   - Implement new functions for checking web and local inclusions

2. **Command-Line Interface**:
   - Create a new `src/cli/inclusionsCommand.ts` file to define the main "inclusions" command
   - Create a new `src/cli/inclusionsListCommand.ts` file to implement the "list" subcommand
   - Add the inclusions command to the main weave command in `src/weave.ts`
   - Add a `--format` option to specify the output format (json or table)

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - Use Cliffy's table module for table output
   - Format the JSON data into a table grouped by inclusion type
   - Include relevant information for each inclusion type

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `weave inclusions list` outputs a table by default, ordered by the `order` property
- [x] `weave inclusions list --format=json` outputs valid JSON
- [x] The core function returns JSON, while the command-line function processes and formats the JSON into a table
- [x] All inclusion types (git, web, local) are properly displayed with relevant information
- [ ] Comprehensive tests cover both table and JSON outputs
- [x] Documentation is updated to include the new command and its options
