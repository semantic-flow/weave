Improve Test Coverage and Quality Assurance

Add comprehensive test coverage across the codebase to ensure reliability and make
future changes safer. This includes unit tests for core utilities, integration
tests for CLI commands, and implementing test coverage reporting.

## Implementation Plan

- Unit Tests for Core Utilities:
  - Add tests for all utility functions in src/core/utils/
    - configUtils.ts
    - determineDefaultBranch.ts
    - determineWorkingBranch.ts
    - gitInclusionUtils.ts
    - handleCaughtError.ts
    - runGitCommand.ts
    - directoryExists.ts
    - ensureSparseConfig.ts
    - configHelpers.ts
  - Focus on edge cases and error conditions
  - Use mocking for file system and git operations

- Integration Tests for CLI Commands:
  - Implement end-to-end tests for CLI commands:
    - weave repos list
    - weave repos commit
    - weave repos checkout
    - weave build
    - weave watch
  - Test various flag combinations and options
  - Verify command output formats
  - Test error handling and edge cases

- Test Coverage Implementation:
  - Set up test coverage reporting tool
  - Configure coverage thresholds
    - Aim for 80% coverage for core utilities
    - Aim for 70% coverage for CLI commands
  - Generate coverage reports in CI pipeline
  - Add coverage badges to README

- Test Infrastructure:
  - Set up test fixtures and helpers
  - Implement git repository mocking
  - Create shared test utilities
  - Document testing practices and patterns
