# Implement "weave build" Command

## Current State

The codebase currently has commands for managing repositories (`repos`) and
listing inclusions (`inclusions list`), but lacks a `build` command that would
copy files from inclusions to the destination directory according to the
configuration.

## Proposed Solution

Implement a new `weave build` command that:

1. Optionally verifies inclusions before building (with verification enabled by
   default)
2. Calls `reposPrepare` to ensure repositories are ready
3. Copies files from all active inclusions to the destination directory
4. Respects per-inclusion copy strategies
5. Processes inclusions in order of their `order` property
6. Supports per-inclusion verification options in the configuration file

## Implementation Plan

1. **Extend Inclusion Types**:
   - Update the inclusion option interfaces in `types.ts` to include
     verification options:
     - For `InputGitOptions` and `GitOptions`, add:
       - `ignoreBehind?: boolean`
       - `ignoreAhead?: boolean`
       - `ignoreDivergent?: boolean`
       - `ignoreCheckoutConsistency?: boolean`
       - `ignoreMissing?: boolean`
       - `ignoreDirty?: boolean`
     - For `InputWebOptions` and `WebOptions`, add:
       - `ignoreRemoteAvailability?: boolean`
     - For `InputLocalOptions` and `LocalOptions`, add:
       - `ignoreLocalEmpty?: boolean`
       - `ignoreMissing?: boolean`

2. **Update Verification Logic**:
   - Modify `inclusionsVerify.ts` and `reposVerify.ts` to respect per-inclusion
     verification options
   - Implement a mechanism to merge global verification options (from command
     line) with per-inclusion options
   - Prioritize per-inclusion options over global options when both are
     specified

3. **Core Functionality**:
   - Create a new `src/core/build.ts` file that:
     - Optionally calls `inclusionsVerify` to check if inclusions are ready
     - Calls `reposPrepare` to prepare repositories
     - Implements file copying logic for all inclusion types (git, web, local)
     - Processes inclusions in order of their `order` property
     - Respects per-inclusion copy strategies, falling back to global strategy
       if not specified
     - Handles potential file collisions according to copy strategy
     - Returns detailed results of the build process

4. **Command-Line Interface**:
   - Create a new `src/cli/buildCommand.ts` file that:
     - Defines the `build` command and its options
     - Adds a `--no-verify` flag to skip verification (default: verification
       enabled)
     - Adds all the verification ignore flags from `inclusionsVerifyCommand.ts`:
       - `--ignore-behind`
       - `--ignore-ahead`
       - `--ignore-divergent`
       - `--ignore-checkout-consistency`
       - `--ignore-missing`
       - `--ignore-dirty`
       - `--ignore-remote-availability`
       - `--ignore-local-empty`
     - Processes and displays the results of the build process
   - Add the build command to the main weave command in `src/weave.ts`

5. **Verification Integration**:
   - Call `inclusionsVerify` if verification is enabled (default)
   - Only proceed with build if verification passes or is skipped with
     `--no-verify`
   - Pass through all ignore flags to the verification function
   - Provide clear error messages if verification fails

6. **Copy Strategy Implementation**:
   - Honor per-inclusion copy strategies
   - Fall back to global copy strategy if not specified
   - Implement all copy strategies:
     - `no-overwrite`: Fail if a file already exists in the destination
     - `overwrite`: Replace existing files in the destination
     - `skip`: Skip files that already exist in the destination
     - `prompt`: Ask the user what to do for each collision

## Configuration Example

```typescript
// Example configuration with per-inclusion verification options
{
  "global": {
    "dest": "_woven",
    "globalCopyStrategy": "no-overwrite"
  },
  "inclusions": [
    {
      "type": "git",
      "name": "Main Content",
      "url": "https://github.com/user/content.git",
      "options": {
        "active": true,
        "copyStrategy": "overwrite",
        "ignoreBehind": true,
        "ignoreDirty": true
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "web",
      "name": "External Resources",
      "url": "https://example.com/resources",
      "options": {
        "active": true,
        "ignoreRemoteAvailability": true
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "local",
      "name": "Local Content",
      "localPath": "./local-content",
      "options": {
        "active": true,
        "ignoreLocalEmpty": true,
        "ignoreMissing": false
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Additional Considerations

1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Consider implementing parallel processing for copying files from multiple
     inclusions
   - Add a progress indicator for large builds

2. **Dry Run Mode**:
   - Support the global `--dryRun` flag to simulate the build without actually
     copying files
   - Show what would be copied and any potential collisions

3. **Collision Detection**:
   - Implement pre-build collision detection to identify potential issues before
     copying
   - Provide suggestions for resolving collisions based on copy strategies

4. **Logging**:
   - Provide detailed logs of the build process
   - Include information about which files were copied, skipped, or overwritten
   - Log any errors or warnings that occurred during the build

5. **Testing**:
   - Create comprehensive tests for the build functionality
   - Test all copy strategies and their interactions
   - Test with various inclusion types (git, web, local)
   - Test error handling and recovery
   - Test per-inclusion verification options

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `weave build` copies files from all active inclusions to the destination
      directory
- [ ] Inclusions are processed in order of their `order` property
- [ ] Verification is performed by default and can be skipped with `--no-verify`
- [ ] All verification ignore flags are supported both globally and
      per-inclusion
- [ ] Per-inclusion verification options take precedence over global options
- [ ] The command respects per-inclusion copy strategies
- [ ] The command handles file collisions according to the specified strategy
- [ ] The command provides clear error messages and suggestions
- [ ] The command works with all inclusion types (git, web, local)
- [ ] Comprehensive tests cover the build functionality
